""" find Max profit you can achieve 
    you may sell once and buy once 
    if you cant make profit return 0
     
    Ex = 
        price=[7,1,5,3,6,4]
         output=5
          
    How ? 
     buy on day 1 (price=1) and 
    sell on 4th day (price=6) 6-1=5
     
      
    Brute Force!!!

''' ðŸ§  Key Intuition:
We want to buy at the lowest price so far.

At each step, compute:

Current profit = current price âˆ’ min price seen so far

Max profit = max of all those profits
